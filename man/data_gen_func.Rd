%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
Generate Simulation Data
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
Generate the simulation data for various models. The data consists of single-dim response y and multi-dim covariates X. For subjects in different clusters, (alpha, beta, zeta, lambda) are different. The function can generate correlated data, by specifying the correlation matrix among X, and balanced/inbalanced data by specifying the cluster probabilities.

For the split model, the data consists of y, fixed covariates W and random covariates Z. For subjects in different clusters, (alpha, beta, psi, zeta, lambda) are different.

For covariates following t and Gamma distributions, only independent covariates are geneated.

\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
For data_gen_func:

The regression coefficients alpha, beta, the mean of X, zeta, and the precision of y, lambda are cluster-specific.

If no cor_mtx value is specified: 1) if rho is a vector of zero's, generated samples have independent X's; 2) if non-zero values are specified in rho, it's assumed to be the D=6, M=3 case, with a blocked-wise correlations of X1-X2, X3-X4 and X5-X6, and correlation coefficients given by rho, if a different setup (eg, different D or M) is desired, cor_mtx must be specified.

The true value of $\zeta$ for the three groups are 0, zeta_sep and 2*zeta_sep respectively.

For data_gen_split:

The regression coefficients alpha, beta for W, psi for Z, the mean of Z, zeta, and the precision of y, lambda, are cluster-specific.

W has a pair-wise correlation of rho.

For data_gen_gamma:

Covariates are independently following a Gamma(z^2, z) distributions, where for the M groups, z = 2+m*zeta_sep, m = 0, 1, ..., M-1.

For data_gen_t:

Covariates are independently following the t_M/sqrt(M/(M-2)) + z, where t_M is the Studentâ€™s t-distribution with a degree of freedom of M, z = m*zeta_sep, m = 0, 1, ..., M-1.
